# InStock

InStock is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that helps manage a warehouse's inventory. This application was developed using React, Node.js, and Express, and is intended for anyone who needs a solution to efficiently manage inventory in a warehouse setting.

The application was built using Agile methodologies and tooling such as Jira and GitHub. Tasks were divided into tickets, which made it easy to assign them to team members and track progress throughout the development process.

## Lessons Learned

Working on the InStock project was a valuable experience that provided good teamwork and project management experience. Using Jira, we planned our workflow and managed the project effectively by breaking down the project into tickets and estimating the necessary time for completion. 

Using GitHub for version control and collaboration was also a crucial aspect of the project. We gained experience with pull requests, merging changes from other branches, and resolving conflicts. 

One of the key takeaways from this project was the importance of clear communication. Developing as a team requires effective communication and collaboration. I came away from this with valuable experience in developing software in a group and an appreciation for the importance of soft skills in software development.
